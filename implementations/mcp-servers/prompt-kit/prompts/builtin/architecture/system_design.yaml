  ## Design Considerations
  1. **Architecture Pattern** - Microservices, Monolith, Serverless, etc.
  2. **Data Storage** - Database choices, caching strategy
  3. **Scalability** - Horizontal/vertical scaling approach
  4. **Availability** - High availability, fault tolerance
  5. **Security** - Authentication, authorization, data protection
  6. **Performance** - Latency requirements, optimization
  7. **Integration** - APIs, third-party services
  8. **Deployment** - CI/CD, infrastructure

  Please provide:
  1. High-level architecture diagram (ASCII/text)
  2. Component descriptions and responsibilities
  3. Data flow and communication patterns
  4. Technology stack recommendations
  5. Scalability strategy
  6. Security considerations
  7. Trade-offs and design decisions
  8. Migration/deployment strategy
