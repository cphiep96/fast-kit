  ## Performance Checklist

  ### Algorithm Efficiency
  - Time complexity (Big O)
  - Space complexity
  - Optimal algorithm choice

  ### Common Issues
  - N+1 query problems
  - Unnecessary loops
  - Inefficient data structures
  - Memory leaks
  - Blocking operations
  - Missing caching
  - Redundant computations

  ### Best Practices
  - Lazy loading
  - Pagination for large datasets
  - Database query optimization
  - Proper indexing
  - Connection pooling
  - Async operations where applicable

  Please provide:
  1. Performance issues identified
  2. Impact assessment for each issue
  3. Time/space complexity analysis
  4. Specific optimization recommendations
  5. Expected performance improvements
  6. Code examples for fixes
  7. Profiling recommendations (if needed)
